We often try to get better by following the latest tech trends such as microservices, serverless and the like.
However, what really makes the key difference is:

# Technical Excellence

A great entry point is the follwing 30mins talk by Martin Fowler:

He points out pretty clearly the key aspects of building and maintaining an organization that aims for technical excellence in the long run.
But there's much more:



## [The engineer/manager pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) @mipsytipsy and tweets by @sarahmei
* Drop the idea that only managers get career progression.
* Drop the idea you have to choose a "lane" and grow old there.
* The best individual contributors are the ones who have done time in management.
* The best technical leaders in the world are often the ones who do both (technical and management). Back and forth. Like a pendulum.
* There are lots of people who do both well - but serially. Not simultaneously.
* ... hybrid manager+tech lead. This is an unstable combination, because your engineering skills and context-sharpness are decaying the longer you do it.
* You can only really improve at one of these things at a time: engineering or management.
* Management is highly interruptive, and great engineering - where you're learning things - requires blocking out interruptions. You can't do these two opposite things at once. As a manager, it is your job to be available for your team, to be interrupted. It is your job to choose to hand off the challenging assignments, so that your engineers can get better at engineering.
* A tech lead is a manager ... but their first priority is achieving the task at hand, not grooming and minding the humans who work on it. They still need the full manager toolset. ... management work, from the slightly shifted perspective of "Get Thing X Done" not "care for these people".
* Tech is the easy part, herding humans is the harder part.
